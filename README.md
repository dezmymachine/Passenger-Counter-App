# Passenger-Counter-App
Passenger counter app from Scrimba JS classes with html, css and javascript
This simple app will put into practice DOM procedures such as event listeners on click and event handlers
Also Javascript functions and Variables along with increment operator will be applied

Great thanks to the scrimba team for a well structured JS course
